# Definition of Done (DoD)

A backlog item is considered "Done" only when:

- Code implements the acceptance criteria.
- TypeScript builds with `npm run build`.
- Lint passes with `npm run lint`.
- Automated tests exist (unit or integration as appropriate) and pass locally and in CI.
- No new console errors in normal user flows.
- Changes are committed with a clear message and small scope.
- Relevant documentation is updated (plans/reviews/evidence).

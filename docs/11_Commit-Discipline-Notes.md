# Delivery Discipline Notes

Goal: Keep a commit history that reflects incremental delivery.

Guidelines used:
- One logical change per commit (docs, test setup, tests, CI, monitoring, etc.).
- Prefer small commits that keep CI green.
- Avoid committing generated output (e.g., `dist/`, `node_modules/`).

Evidence:
- [ ] Add link to the GitHub repository once pushed.

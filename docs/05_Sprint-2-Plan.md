# Sprint 2 Plan — Execution & Improvement

## Sprint Goal
Apply Sprint 1 learnings, improve observability, and deliver the next increment with monitoring/logging and expanded coverage.

## Selected Backlog Items
1. Basic monitoring/logging for key events (2 SP)
2. Persist cart across refresh (2 SP) — add tests to validate safe rehydration
3. Evidence artifacts for sprint reviews and retrospectives (2 SP)

Total: 6 SP

## Process Improvements (to apply)
- Keep commits small and message scopes clear.
- Add tests alongside changes (not at the end).
- Ensure CI stays green (fix failures immediately).

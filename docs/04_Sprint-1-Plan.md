# Sprint 1 Plan — Execution

## Sprint Goal
Deliver the first increment of reliable working software by validating core cart/order flows with automated tests and establishing a CI pipeline.

## Selected Backlog Items
1. CI pipeline runs lint, tests, and build (2 SP)
2. Add desserts to cart and increase quantity (3 SP) — proven via integration test(s)
3. Decrease quantity and remove at zero (3 SP) — proven via unit + integration test(s)

Total: 8 SP

## Notes
- Primary deliverable is not new UI, but **verified behavior** + DevOps pipeline.
- Commit history should reflect incremental progress (setup → first tests → more tests → CI).

\fs32\b 2. Product Vision\b0\par
\fs22 Dessert Store is a lightweight web app that lets users browse desserts, add them to a cart, adjust quantities, and confirm an order with a clear summary.\par
\par
\fs22 The goal is a fast, reliable, and accessible ordering flow with cart state that persists across page refreshes.\par
\par
\fs32\b 3. Product Backlog\b0\par
\fs22 Scales used:\par
\fs22 \u8226? Priority\u58? P0 (highest) \u8594? P2 (lower)\par
\fs22 \u8226? Estimation\u58? story points (SP) using relative sizing\par

\fs26\b Backlog Items\b0\par
\par
\fs24\b 1) Add desserts to cart and increase quantity\b0\par
\fs22 Priority: P0\par
\fs22 Estimate: 3 SP\par
\fs22 User story: As a user, I can add a dessert to my cart and increase its quantity so I can order multiple portions.\par
\fs22 Acceptance criteria:\par
\fs22 \u8226? Clicking \u8220?Add to Cart\u8221? adds the item to the cart with quantity 1.\par
\fs22 \u8226? When quantity \u62? 0, the product card shows a stepper with \u8220?Increase\u8221? and \u8220?Decrease\u8221?.\par
\fs22 \u8226? Increasing quantity updates the cart count and totals.\par
\par
\fs24\b 2) Decrease quantity and remove at zero\b0\par
\fs22 Priority: P0\par
\fs22 Estimate: 3 SP\par
\fs22 User story: As a user, I can decrease quantity so I can correct my order.\par
\fs22 Acceptance criteria:\par
\fs22 \u8226? Clicking \u8220?Decrease quantity\u8221? reduces the quantity by 1.\par
\fs22 \u8226? If quantity becomes 0, the item disappears from the cart.\par
\fs22 \u8226? When the cart becomes empty, the empty-cart message is shown.\par
\par
\fs24\b 3) Remove an item from the cart\b0\par
\fs22 Priority: P0\par
\fs22 Estimate: 2 SP\par
\fs22 User story: As a user, I can remove an item completely so I can quickly discard something I don\u8217?t want.\par
\fs22 Acceptance criteria:\par
\fs22 \u8226? Clicking \u8220?Remove item\u8221? deletes the item from the cart.\par

\fs22 User story: As a user, I can confirm my order so I can see a final summary before starting a new order.\par
\fs22 Acceptance criteria:\par
\fs22 \u8226? Clicking \u8220?Confirm Order\u8221? shows an \u8220?Order Confirmed\u8221? modal.\par
\fs22 \u8226? The modal lists each item, its quantity, and line total.\par
\fs22 \u8226? The modal shows the final order total.\par
\par
\fs24\b 5) Persist cart across refresh\b0\par
\fs22 Priority: P1\par
\fs22 Estimate: 2 SP\par
\fs22 User story: As a user, my cart is saved so I don\u8217?t lose it when I refresh the page.\par
\fs22 Acceptance criteria:\par
\fs22 \u8226? Cart loads initial state from localStorage key dessert_cart.\par
\fs22 \u8226? Updates write back to localStorage.\par

\fs22 \u8226? No new console errors in normal user flows.\par
\fs22 \u8226? Changes are committed with a clear message and small scope.\par
\fs22 \u8226? Relevant documentation is updated (plans/reviews).\par
\par
\fs32\b 5. Sprint 1 Plan\b0\par
\fs22 Sprint Goal: Deliver the first increment of reliable working software by validating core cart/order flows with automated tests and establishing a CI pipeline.\par
\par
\fs22 Selected Backlog Items (2\u8211?3 stories):\par
\fs22 1. CI pipeline runs lint, tests, and build (2 SP)\par
\fs22 2. Add desserts to cart and increase quantity (3 SP) \u8212? proven via integration test(s)\par

\par
\fs22 Total: 8 SP\par
\par
\fs22 Notes:\par
\fs22 \u8226? Primary deliverable is verified behavior + DevOps pipeline (not new UI).\par
\fs22 \u8226? Commit history should reflect incremental progress (setup \u8594? first tests \u8594? more tests \u8594? CI).\par
\par
\fs32\b 6. Sprint 1 Review\b0\par

\fs22 \u8226? UI tests initially failed due to ambiguous text matches (prices appear in multiple places).\par
\fs22 \u8226? Test runner failed when there were zero test files (needed at least one test to pass).\par
\par
\fs22 Improvements for Sprint 2 (commit to at least 2):\par
\fs22 1. Scope UI assertions to specific regions (use within(...)) to avoid brittle tests.\par
\fs22 2. Add basic logging/monitoring (structured logs + error boundary) to improve troubleshooting.\par
